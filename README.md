# Capestra-Furniture
Ecommerce internal ordering database 
This is a class project that I have decided to continue adding to in my free time. I've enjoyed developing ecommerce
sites and have self-taught back end and front end development for about four years, where I have now acquired education
and experience with full stack Java development as well. This project specifically is being performed with Java in
Netbeans IDE 8.2, MySQL 5.7.23, JDK 1.8, and JDBC Driver.
